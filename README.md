# UNIFR_RE_PROJECT_C

Repository containing the essential classes used for the project.

Mostly it's about the src folder:

- pictures including a banner for the log in page
- different html pages (log in, home, courses) with their respective .ts pages
- my-app files to ensure the Aurelia logic (my-app.ts and my-app.html especially for the routing)
- main.ts to structure the launch of the web app
